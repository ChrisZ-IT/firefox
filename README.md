# Firefox
userChrome.css and other settings for setting up vertical tabs in Firefox

## How to use
1. Make a backup of your current chrome\userChrome.css located in your root Firefox profile (Path can be found by going to about:profiles)
2. Copy my userChrome.css file into your profile's chrome directory or copy the contents into your userchrome.css file.
3. Set bookmarks toolbar to only show on new tabs (makes ff look cleaner but is optional)

4. Install the extension Sidebery to enable vertical tabs (I also recommend multi-account containers for added security cross accounts/sites)
Â  a. I forget all the settings I set in sidebery but I think it was setting Layout to hidden
5. navigate to about:config and set sidebar.revamp to false
6. Restart Firefox


example of what this looks like expanded and collapsed when you mouse over/off of the side bar.
